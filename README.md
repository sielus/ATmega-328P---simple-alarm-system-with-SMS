# How it works?
While alarm is arming, user can only write password for unarming. 

When armed alarm detects any :
- movement 
- smoke (fire)

**It will be turn on siren, send message (like fire or burglary) and call to chosen user on his phone!**

However, if the alarm detects :
- Lower temp than 3 degrees
- Disabled 230V AC

**Only specified message will be sended**
